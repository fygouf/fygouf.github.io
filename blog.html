        </h3><p>For some time now, I have been questioning the relevance of graded homework, and this reflection has been accelerated by the democratization of generative artificial intelligence tools that can solve complex mathematical problems with just a few clicks. As an evaluator, am I assessing the work of a motivated student? Ten times the work of a motivated student copied by nine less motivated students? The work of a conversational agent? For a student, is it useful to spend hours stuck on a question that is too difficult when a little help could easily unblock the situation?</p>

            Experimenting a new format in exercise session
          </a>
        </h3><p>Seeking to boost student engagement and learning outcomes, I recently implemented a new format for exercise sessions with my students at the University of Rennes. Collaborating with our university’s pedagogical support center, the <a href="https://suptice.univ-rennes.fr">suptice</a>, we collected feedback from 39 students (out of 100 surveyed) who experienced the new approach. In this post, I’ll outline the format and its advantages and limitations, as highlighted by students’ responses.</p>

        </h3><p>Welcome to my new website! I built it using Jekyll with the Minima theme. It took some time to get the hang of it, but now updating and managing the site will be much more enjoyable.
